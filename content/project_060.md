### White Page â€” <small>Daily planner</small>

Proof of concept for a daily planner app. The idea is to have a blank page for
each day, divided into two parts: todo on the left, done on the right.

That allows you to quickly focus on what you need to do today, and see the
progress you've made, rewarding yourself for the things you've done.

The app is hosted on serverless infrastructure, using AWS Lambda.
