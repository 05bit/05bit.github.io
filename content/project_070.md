### Docta â€” <small>Lightweght static site generator</small>

Minimalistic static site generator written in Python, focused on structured
navigation and content organization. Content is organized as simple directory
strucure, with each directory representing a chapter, and each Markdown file
representing a page. The generator is built on top of Jinja2 templating engine.
We are aware of MkDocs and Sphinx, but we needed something more lightweight.
