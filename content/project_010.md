### Spheroid Universe â€” <small>early prototype</small>

Our team contributed on the very early stage to Spheroid Universe
allowing to bootstrap the business of selling digital assets. We
helped to create the model of slicing the Earth surface into pieces
that are identified by integer coordinates. We also created a first
version of back-end to store and manage the data and process payments.

Project and the team has grown vastly since then and is now leading
on the market.
