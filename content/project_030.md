### Hypple â€” <small>Geo location based social network</small>

Hypple is a social network that allows users to share their location and
interact with other users in the same area. It was a mobile app for iOS
and Android. It also interacted with Instagram API to allow users to
explore and share content.

On the back-end side we used Python, Tornado, PostgreSQL and Redis for
real-time chatting and interactions.

It was a startup project that we funded by ourselves. It gained initial
traction, yet was struggling to fundraise. We decided to shut it down.
