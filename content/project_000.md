### peewee-async â€” <small>open source async ORM interface</small>

The library is built on top of **peewee ORM** and **asyncio**. It provides
a simple interface to work with database in asynchronous manner. To the date
of creation, it was the only ORM besides SQL Alchemy that supported async
queries. The **peewee** itself is very elegant and performant ORM, so we
decided to power it with async capabilities.
