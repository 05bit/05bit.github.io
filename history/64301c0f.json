Please note that this code is just an example and may require modifications to work correctly in your environment.\n\n```\nimport os\nimport boto3\nimport urllib3\nfrom botocore.signers import RequestSigner\n\ndef upload_to_s3():\n    # Set up S3 client\n    s3 = boto3.client('s3')\n    bucket_name = 'your-bucket-name'\n\n    # Set up HTTP client\n    http = urllib3.PoolManager()\n\n    # Set up request signer\n    region = 'your-region'\n    service = 's3'\n    credentials = boto3.Session().get_credentials()\n    signer = RequestSigner(service, region, 's3', 'aws4', credentials, datetime.now())\n\n    # Set up directory to scan\n    directory = 'htdocs'\n\n    # Loop through files in directory\n    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):\n        for file in files:\n            # Set up file path and S3 key\n            file_path = os.path.join(root, file)\n            s3_key = file_path.replace(directory, '').lstrip('/')\n\n            # Set up HTTP request\n            url = f'https://{bucket_name}.s3.{region}.amazonaws.com/{s3_key}'\n            headers = {'x-amz-content-sha256': 'UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD'}\n            request = http.Request('PUT', url, headers=headers)\n\n            # Sign request\n            signed_request = signer.sign(request, bucket_name)\n\n            # Upload file to S3\n            with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:\n                response = http.urlopen(signed_request, body=f.read())\n\n            print(f'Uploaded {file_path} to S3 bucket {bucket_name} with key {s3_key}')\n```\n\nTo use this function, simply call `upload_to_s3()` and it will scan the `htdocs` directory and upload all files to the specified S3 bucket. You will need to replace `your-bucket-name` and `your-region` with your actual bucket name and region. You may also need to modify the `credentials` variable to use the appropriate AWS access keys."

You can modify the `content_dir` variable to point to a different directory if needed."
